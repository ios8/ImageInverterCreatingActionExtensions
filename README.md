# ImageInverter: Creating Action Extensions

This sample code shows how to use an Action extension with a view controller. 
The app shares an image through a UIActivityViewController while the extension can be used to flip vertically the shared image and return it to the host app. 
The host app and extension are communicating using NSExtensionItem and NSItemProvider. The extension shows the basic interaction with the NSExtensionContext.
